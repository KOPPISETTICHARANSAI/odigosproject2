          </li>
          <li>
            Attendance is taken every hour at the commencement of the class.
            Students not present at the beginning of the hour will be considered
            as absent to the respective class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students who come late cannot enter the class without the permission
            of the teacher in the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regular attendance is strictly insisted upon. A student requiring
            leave for the whole day or a part there of should apply for it in
            advance, in the prescribed form given in the calendar, in person to
            the concerned lecturer before the commencement of the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every leave application should be counter signed by the parent or
            authorized guardian and academic adviser failing to which, it will
            be rejected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Owing to illness or other unforeseen circumstances, if a student is
            unable to apply for leave in advance, can obtain leave
            retrospectively and must get the leave sanctioned on the day of
            return to the college.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the absence exceeds three days, leave note should be submitted to
            the Principal. In case of illness student must produce a medical
            certificate issued by a competent authority, preferably Asst.

          <li>
            The Mangalore University insists that a student should normally
            attend at least 75% of the lectures and the practical in each
            subject.

            condoned by the University.
          </li>
          <li>
            The condonation cannot be insisted upon as a matter of right. In
            fact, the Principal will not make such a recommendation, if in his
            opinion, the student’s absence often used to be without sufficient
            justification.

            attendance later on this ground. For such claim documentary voidance
            is necessary. Attendance cannot be claimed on flimsy reasons
            like-picnic, function at home, excursion, voluntary work etc.

          <li>
            If the attendance is below 60% in any one subject, the student shall
            not be permitted to appear for University examinations.
          </li>

            pay a penalty of Rs.900/- per subject in addition to production of
